    <p>My name is Tracy Le. I am Vietnamese American born in Northern California. I currently live in San Diego and it's been four years living in this beautiful city! 
        I received my Bachelor's degree in Art History from Arizona State University. My passion for art grew during my high school years and learning about museum practices
        have always been fascinating. In my free time I enjoy visiting different museums with my friends and family. Museums I recommend to visit in San Diego:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>San Diego Museum of Art</li>
        <li>Museum of Contemporary Art of San Diego</li>
        <li>San Diego Art Institute</li>
    </ol>
